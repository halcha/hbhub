        <h1>What is HB HUB?</h1>
        <article>
        <p>HB Hub is a platform for all members or as we like to call them ‘Players’, to share their opinion on a variety of topics, from financial services and current affairs to food and personal preferences.</p>
        <p>Every time a player logs into their dashboard they have the opportunity to complete various activities including surveys, quizzes and polls in exchange for points which they can later cash in for rewards.</p>  
        <p>These rewards include exclusive offers, luxury prize draws, charitable donations and gift cards of a player’s choosing. Each interaction strengthens our relationship and understanding of each individual player, which in turn enables us to create the ultimate, curated and personalised experience for our members.</p>
